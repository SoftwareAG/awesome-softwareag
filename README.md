### adapya – Adabas Python packages

[adapya-adabas](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/adapya-adabas) - Adapya-adabas implements the Adabas database API for Python. It can access local and remote Adabas databases. adapya-adabas comes with scripts and sample programs to show its features. It is being used on Linux, mainframe z/OS, Solaris and Windows.

[adapya-base](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/adapya-base) - Adapya-base provides the foundations for the other adapya packages – e.g. the Datamap class. adapya-base comes with scripts to transfer files from mainframe or process SMF performance records.

[adapya-entirex](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/adapya-entirex) - adapya-entirex implements the EntireX API for Python.
